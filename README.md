# dataset-collector

This repository aims to collect images with deep learning algorithm which you already have.

For some AI developer, the most difficult step in developing is dataset preparation, which is the biggest gap between you and big company. Besides, some developer is lack of data which collected from real world or working scene.

In order to collect more image data from real world, I promote a simple project to make it easy to collect dataset for everyone, only need the algorithm you already have.

What is more, this is only a dataset collector project, we need a additional data annotation project to sovel the problem of labeling manually (like label-studio)

The ultimate goal is to implement a pluggable function, as a component of automatic semi-supervised training platform. The rest components of the platform is algorithm model training pipeline, the manually label tools, and the platform of model inference.

## dataset collector service

the project will support these dataset of algorithm, but I should relize step by step...

- [ ] object detection

- [ ] segmentation

- [ ] instance segmentation

- [ ] text categorization

- [ ] ...

## Note

This project is still in development, so I will update the project frequently.
